# Legal NLP

The judicial systems across the globe are not just overloaded with the number of cases but deal with numerous other challenges like information overload, inefficiency in case research, limited accessibility for non-legal experts, bias and lack of transparency, to name a few. 

The integration of Legal NLP with the Legal Frameworks offers solutions to such challenges and is capable to act as an aid to the respective stakeholders with all the ethical considerations to scale them and improves access for citizens through simplification and translation. Legal NLP highlights various legal objectives, one such being Argumentation mining, which aims at identifying, extracting and analyzing the argumentative segment of a case hearing in the legal judgement. This not only helps to focus on the segments that directly or indirectly influence the judgment, but most importantly, unfolds the complex and layered patterns of reasoning behind it as well. The patterns of general reasoning behind an argument varies vastly from what we witness in a courtroom. 

Law is a vocab-rich and vocab-specific domain, which has unique exceptions and nuances, which deals with the hierarchical nature of issues, evidence, and claims within it. To understand the complexity of it and unravel the logic of reasoning of such layers, Legal NLP is crucial to make it more accountable, justifiable, and explainable to assist the stakeholders and also come up with more valid and transparent paradigm of reasoning and hence judgement.
